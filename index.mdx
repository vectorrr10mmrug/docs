**SolTap** is a community tool built for Solana users to reclaim **dormant SOL** from their own wallets.

ðŸ”¥ **Burn** any unwanted Tokens or NFTs and **claim back the rent in $SOL**.  
ðŸ’¸ Any wallet that has traded on **Pumpfun**, **Raydium**, or **Jupiter** can claim free $SOL.

#### ðŸ§  How It Works

On Solana, storing data for tokens and NFTs requires a small **rent deposit**.  
This mechanism helps prevent on-chain spam with meaningless data.

> **Most users donâ€™t know this.**  
> The rent stays there **forever** unless you reclaim it.

**SolTap** was created to help you **recover this forgotten SOL**.  
Through an intuitive interface, you can **close inactive accounts in bulk** and **withdraw all the accumulated rent**.

ðŸš€ **Try it now and reclaim whatâ€™s yours!**
