# &#x20;SolTap Overview

SolTap | A community tool tailored for Solana users to reclaim dormant SOL from their own wallets.

🔥 Burn any unwanted Tokens or NFTs and claim back the rent ($SOL). 💸 Any wallet that has traded on Pumpfun, Raydium or Jupiter can claim free $SOL.\
\
🧠 How does it work?\
\
Storing data of tokens and NFTs on Solana costs a small deposit. Such design is to discourage on-chain spam with meaningless data.

**However, most users do not know about it.**

This rent will stay “forever”, if the users do not claim it back.\
\
SolTap is therefore created to help users to claim this dormant SOL back in their hands. Through this intuitive interface, users can close their inactive account(s) in bulk and withdraw their SOL rent.

Try it! 👊
